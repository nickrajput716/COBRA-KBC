<!-- COBRA -KBC -->

Cobra KBC is a Python-based quiz game inspired by the popular show Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC). The game has been designed with engaging features, ensuring an immersive experience for players. Below is a detailed summary of the project:

# Features and Functionalities Lifelines:
 -> The game incorporates six lifelines to assist players during challenging questions. Each lifeline can be used only once.

 1. 50:50: Eliminates two incorrect options, leaving one correct answer and one incorrect option. 

 2. Phone a Friend: Simulates asking a friend for advice with a probability-based response.

 3. Audience Poll: Displays a percentage-based bar chart representing the audience's choices.

 4. Switch the Question: Allows the player to skip the current question and get a new one.

 5. Ask the Expert: Provides the correct answer with a high probability.

 6. Power Paplu: Revives a previously used lifeline, granting it for reuse.

 -> Winning Cost Calculation and Display:

 Displays the total winning amount as well as the player's progress at each level.
 Ensures the excitement of gradually increasing rewards.

 -> Randomization:

 Questions and options are randomized to enhance replayability.
 Lifelines like Audience Poll and Phone a Friend generate dynamic and randomized outputs.
 -> Basic Functionalities:

 Seamless navigation between questions.
 Input validation to ensure the game runs smoothly without crashes.
 Modules Used:

 1. random: To randomize questions, answers, and certain lifeline outputs.
 2. time: To add delays, enhancing the user experience with a game-show-like feel.
 -> Gameplay Highlights
 Players answer a series of multiple-choice questions to win increasing amounts of virtual money.
 The game dynamically adjusts to lifeline usage and keeps players informed of their progress.
 Thoughtful integration of lifelines ensures strategic gameplay while maintaining fairness.
 Technical Strengths
 =>Python Programming: The project showcases solid programming skills with proper use of functions, conditionals, and loops.
 =>Modular Design: Features are modularly designed, making the code easy to maintain and expand.
 =>Interactive Experience: User-friendly inputs and engaging lifeline mechanics make the game fun and interactive.
